Write a program that creates two processes A and B. Process A reads a file "data.in" that can be of any type (exe, pdf, doc, etc), and then sends its content through UNIX pipe to process B, which in turn saves the received data into another file "data.out". 
The program will be tested by an arbitrary file I have and then verified based on its type. For example, if it's a pdf file, "data.out" should be opened successfully by a PDF reader. 
If it's a video file, the output file can be replayed.

To ensure the correctness, please use binary file read/write for your program.
