Please complete Problem 5 in Chapter 4 (image shown below). Matrix A and B should be read from two files named "A.txt" and "B.txt". The program should print the result matrix C on the screen. You may create your own test files A.txt and B.txt but your program will be graded with my own test files.
Your program should execute with command line arguments M, N, and K, indicating that matrix A is of size MxN and matrix B is of size NxK. Therefore, matrix C is of size MxK.
For example, your program may run like "./P3.exe 10 8 6".
