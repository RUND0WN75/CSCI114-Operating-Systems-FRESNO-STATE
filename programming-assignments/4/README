In this program, we will implement a one-way tunnel synchronization. Cars arriving the tunnel
may go either north direction or south direction. The rules for entering the tunnel is set as follows:

If a car arrives and there is no car in the tunnel, the car can enter the tunnel without waiting;
N-batch rule: at most N consecutive, same-direction cars can enter the tunnel;

If N cars in one direction have been waiting, no more cars in the other direction may enter the
tunnel, even if the total number of cars in that direction is less than N;

If N cars in one direction already entered the tunnel but no car in the other direction is waiting,
then the (N+1)th car may enter the tunnel as the first car in the N-batch rule stated above.

Each car should be treated as a separate thread and your program should be able to handle up
to 2000-5000 cars arriving in each direction.

Your program should execute with command line argument N, indicating the maximum numbers
of cars allowed in the tunnel for any direction. N ranges from 5 to 15.

For example, your program may run like "./P4.exe 8".

Each thread reads a list of requests from a common file cars.txt. Each line of the file has just the
direction information.

Sample input: cars.txt

Your program should keep running without crashing, deadlock, or violating the tunnel rules.

Testing
Your program should print major events. For example:
#1 north direction car arriving
#1 south direction car arriving
#1 north direction car waiting
#1 north direction car entering the tunnel
#1 north direction car leaving the tunnel
N cars have been waiting
Nth car has left the tunnel
etc
